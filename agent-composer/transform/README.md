# buildkite-on-demand-transform

This project contains source code and supporting files for a CloudFormation
Macro that you can deploy with the SAM CLI or from the Serverless Application
Repository. It includes the following files and folders:

- src - Code for the macro's Lambda function.
- src/tests - Unit tests for the macro code. 
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the macro's AWS resources.

The template defines several AWS resources:

- A Lambda function
- A CloudWatch Log group for the Lambda Function
- A CloudFormation Macro
- A CloudWatch Log group for the CloudWatch Macro

## Deploy the application

The CloudFormation Macro resources can be deployed using the Serverless
Application Repository or the SAM CLI.

[![Deploy AWS Serverless Application](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:832577133680:applications~buildkite-on-demand-transform)

To deploy using the SAM CLI, you need the following tools:

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

To build and deploy the application for the first time, run the following in
your shell:

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

This command will build the application package and deploy your application to
your AWS account. Ensure you are authenticate to the same account you plan to
use the macro from. You will be presented with a series of prompts:

* **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should
be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be
something like buildkite-on-demand-macro.
* **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to inside your
account.
* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modified IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `hello-world/package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ sam local start-api
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name buildkite-on-demand-transform --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `hello-world/tests` folder in this project. Use NPM to install the [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/) and run unit tests.

```bash
buildkite-on-demand-transform$ cd hello-world
hello-world$ npm install
hello-world$ npm run test
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name buildkite-on-demand-transform
```

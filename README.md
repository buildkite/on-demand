# Buildkite On-Demand

Buildkite On-Demand is a platform for running Buildkite Agents
on container orchestration platforms such as ECS and Kubernetes.

There are currently two implementations available:

- [Buildkite On-Demand ECS](ecs)
- [Buildkite On-Demand EKS](eks)

The EKS implementation of the pattern can also be adapted to run
on a generic non-AWS Kubernetes cluster.
